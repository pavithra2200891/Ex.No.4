### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

4) Applied Prompt Patterns
4.1 Comparative Analysis Prompt

Purpose: Evaluate multiple design options before choosing the best.

Prompt Example:
“Compare using wired vs wireless IoT sensors for real-time machine monitoring in terms of cost, reliability, and scalability.”

Expected Response (Sample Table):

Option	Cost	Reliability	Scalability
Wired Sensors	High	Very High	Limited
Wireless Sensors	Moderate	Moderate–High	Excellent

Outcome: Wireless sensors preferred for scalability in large factories.

4.2 Universal Prompt

Purpose: A single general template applicable to multiple system functions.

Template:
“Task: {monitoring/prediction/optimization}
Goal: {improve efficiency / reduce downtime / save energy}
Constraints: {safety, reliability, ease of use}
Output: {steps / table / recommendations}”

Example:
Task: predictive maintenance
Goal: reduce downtime
Constraints: ensure operator safety
Output: list 3 actions with confirmation step

Expected Response:

Monitor vibration sensors for anomalies

Compare with historical failure data

Trigger alert if threshold exceeded
→ “Would you like me to schedule maintenance now?”

4.3 Structured Prompt Refinements

Purpose: Iteratively refine system outputs into a clear, structured format.

Initial Prompt: “Explain how predictive maintenance works.”
Refined Prompt: “Explain predictive maintenance in 3 bullet points: definition, method, benefit.”

Generated Output:

Definition: Predictive maintenance uses IoT data to forecast failures.

Method: Monitors parameters (temperature, vibration, current).

Benefit: Reduces downtime and extends equipment lifespan.

4.4 Prompt Size Limitations

Purpose: Manage information overload by restricting length.

Prompt Example:
“Summarize the benefits of IoT-based automation in exactly 3 sentences.”

Expected Response:
“IoT automation improves production by enabling real-time machine monitoring. Predictive maintenance reduces downtime and prevents costly breakdowns. Energy optimization lowers operating costs and enhances sustainability.”

5) Scenario Walkthroughs (End-to-End)

A) Predictive Maintenance Case

Comparative Prompt: Choose between vibration vs temperature sensors.

Universal Prompt: Apply maintenance prediction framework.

Structured Refinement: Format in steps + confirmation.

Size Limitation: Summary in 3 sentences for manager briefing.

B) Energy Efficiency Case

Comparative Prompt: Compare manual scheduling vs AI-based load balancing.

Universal Prompt: Task = energy optimization → Output = 3 methods.

Structured Refinement: Express savings in a table.

Size Limitation: Compress findings into a short report for decision-makers.

6) Evaluation Plan

Metrics:

Clarity: responses understandable to operators/managers

Accuracy: grounded in actual IoT/automation use cases

Efficiency: ability to summarize when length is limited

KPIs:

Production efficiency ↑ 30%

Downtime ↓ 25–40%

Energy savings ↑ 15%

7) Sample Conversations

Operator: “How can I prevent downtime in Machine M2?”
Bot (Universal Prompt): “Task: predictive maintenance → Monitor vibration, compare with thresholds, alert if abnormal. Would you like to schedule maintenance?”

Manager: “Compare wired and wireless sensors.”
Bot (Comparative Prompt): “Wired = costly but stable. Wireless = cheaper and more scalable. For large plants, wireless is recommended.”

Executive: “Summarize benefits in 3 sentences.”
Bot (Size Limitation): “IoT automation boosts productivity, reduces downtime, and saves energy.”

8) Result

Thus, the manufacturing automation system was successfully analyzed and designed using diverse prompting techniques such as Comparative Analysis, Universal Prompting, Structured Prompt Refinements, and Prompt Size Limitations. These techniques ensured clarity, efficiency, and adaptability in system design and communication.


# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
